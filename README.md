# Description

The goal is to create a web app that allows to upload, edit and export a pdf file. We have upload page and where user can upload a file from his/her device/local. Further user has a role based access. User 1 can add the boxes and User 2 can edit the boxes added by User 1. At the end user can export the file.

<ul className="step-list">

    <li>Select the preferred user. User 1 can draw boxes and User 2 can write and sign in the boxes.</li>
    <li>We can also change the user in the edit screen in the page header.</li>
    <li>Make the edits as User 1/ User 2</li>
    <li>Export the edited File</li>
</ul>
